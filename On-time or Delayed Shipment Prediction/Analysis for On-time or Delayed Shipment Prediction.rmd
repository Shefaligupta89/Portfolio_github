## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#points to note from Correlation Analysis

# Discount_offered has a moderate positive correlation coefficient of 0.397 with Reached.on.Time_Y.N. This suggests that a higher discount offered may be associated with a higher likelihood of reaching on time. However, correlation alone does not establish causation, so further analysis is required.
# 
# Cost_of_the_Product and Customer_care_calls both have negative correlation coefficients with Reached.on.Time_Y.N, but the magnitudes of the correlations are relatively weak (-0.074 and -0.067, respectively). This indicates a potential but weak negative relationship.
# 
# Other features such as Customer_rating, Prior_purchases, and Weight_in_gms do not show strong correlations with Reached.on.Time_Y.N based on the provided correlation matrix.

#Points to note from Anova Analysis

# In summary, the ANOVA analysis indicates that Customer_care_calls, Cost_of_the_Product, Prior_purchases,
# Discount_offered, and Weight_in_gms are statistically significant predictors of the target variable 
# Reached.on.Time_Y.N. However, Customer_rating does not have a statistically significant relationship
# with the target variable based on the given significance level

```{r}
# Based on the stepwise regression analysis, the important variables for 
# predicting the target variable "Reached.on.Time_Y.N" are:
# 
# 1.Customer_care_calls
# 2.Cost_of_the_Product
# 3.Prior_purchases
# 4.Discount_offered
# 5.Weight_in_gms
# These variables have been selected based on their contribution to the model's fit,
# as indicated by the p-values and the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values. 
# These variables have statistically significant coefficients and are considered 
# important in predicting the target variable.
